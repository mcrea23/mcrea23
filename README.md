Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over 8 years of experience in the telecommunications and retail industries, I have learned how to work efficiently in team settings toward common goals while also successfully working independently. I have always thrived on adapting in new environments starting from a young age living between two countries. I'm excited to move into an engineering role that merges my past experience with my enthusiasm for technology that improves people's lives.4
